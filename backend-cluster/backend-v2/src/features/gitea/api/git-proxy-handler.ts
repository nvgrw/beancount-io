 * Gitea REST API proxy rather than a git transport: `/git/api/v1/user`
 * returned the caller's Gitea profile, and
 * `DELETE /git/api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/branch_protections/{name}` let a
 * user delete their own branch protection (verified 2026-08-15, HTTP 204).
 * Anything we express as Gitea repository state — the main-only branch policy,
 * and the free-tier quota lock designed in ADR 0001 — is only enforceable if
 * the user it applies to cannot reach the API that edits it.
 *
 * Git's smart HTTP protocol only ever issues these three requests, so the
 * allowlist is exhaustive rather than a heuristic:
 *
 *   GET  <owner>/<repo>[.git]/info/refs?service=git-(upload|receive)-pack
 *   POST <owner>/<repo>[.git]/git-upload-pack
 *   POST <owner>/<repo>[.git]/git-receive-pack
 *
 * The owner and repo segments must start alphanumeric, so `..` can never be a
 * segment and the path cannot traverse out of a repository. Dumb HTTP
 * (`/objects/...`, `/HEAD`) is deliberately not forwarded; git negotiates smart
 * HTTP by default and no client here needs the fallback.
