/**
 * Redis cache for a ledger's loaded `.bean` FileMap, keyed by the repo's HEAD
 * commit SHA. This is the in-process replacement for the deleted Python fava
 * service's `LRUCache[FavaLedger]`.
 *
 * Why SHA-keyed instead of a push webhook: git is content-addressed, so a push
 * moves the HEAD SHA. Embedding that SHA in the cache key means a push yields a
 * *different* key → an automatic miss → a fresh fetch, and the superseded
 * entry ages out by TTL. No `repo-push` invalidation webhook is required — the
 * commit SHA *is* the invalidation signal (cleaner than fava's mtime/LRU +
 * push-webhook pairing).
 *
 * The cached value contains the FileMap, repository paths, and optional
 * commit-derived `.beancountio.json` entrypoint. The resolved entry point is
 * NOT part of the key: an internal override is applied and validated in-memory
 * after retrieval (`requireEntryPoint`). A load with a missing resolved entry
 * point therefore still caches the commit payload before the error propagates.
 *
 * HEAD-SHA resolution is coalesced per client instance: concurrent loads for
 * the same repo through the same client (e.g. parallel GraphQL resolvers of
 * one dashboard query) share a single in-flight `repoGetAllCommits` call. The
 * memo is in-flight-only (dropped as soon as it settles), so it introduces no
 * staleness window. Scoping it to the client instance — rather than globally
 * per repo — is what keeps it access-safe: the Gitea client factory memoizes
 * client instances per credential, so same-credential callers coalesce while
 * distinct credentials never share a resolution.
 *
 * Access safety: the SHA is resolved with the SAME user-scoped client used for
 * the load, so an unauthorized caller cannot resolve the SHA for a private repo
 * and therefore cannot construct the cache key; and if resolution is skipped
 * (see below), the fallback load uses that same client. The cache never widens
 * who can read a repo.
