/**
 * Centralized cache key registry for consistent namespacing and collision
 * prevention.
 *
 * Pattern: `domain:resource:identifier[:sub]`
 * - domain: Feature or area (ledger, ...)
 * - resource: The kind of value cached (status, profile, xml, ...)
 * - identifier/sub: Optional scoping values (userId, locale, ...)
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Prevents key collisions through consistent namespacing
 * - Type-safe key generation
 * - Single place to audit every cache key in use
 *
 * Note: keys here are namespaced again by Keyv at the
 * Redis layer, so these strings are the logical key within that namespace.
 *
 * @example
 * import { CACHE_KEYS } from "@/shared/cache";
 * const key = CACHE_KEYS.feed.bySourceLocale("blog", "en");
