Beancount.io is a developer-friendly workspace for [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/) ledgers. Your books remain readable plain text while the surrounding tools add polished reports, transaction entry, Git-backed collaboration, automation, and access from the browser, phone, terminal, or a coding agent.

## Mobile apps

Review your finances, add transactions, scan receipts, and edit ledger files from the native Beancount client. The same open ledger remains available from the web, terminal, Python, and agent workflows.

## Why developers build with it

- **Open, inspectable data** — ledgers are text files that work with Git, scripts, editors, and the wider Beancount ecosystem.
- **Useful at every layer** — use the finished interfaces, automate local `.bean` files from Python, or build new workflows on the parsing and reporting library.
- **Modern, typed stacks** — React 19, React Native, TypeScript, GraphQL, Python 3.12, strict type checking, and package-scoped CI.
- **Agent-ready workflows** — the CLI and reusable skills give coding agents structured ways to create, validate, query, and update ledgers.
- **MIT licensed** — clients, developer tools, and libraries can be studied, adapted, and extended.

| [`backend-cluster/`](./backend-cluster) | Active backend              | The services behind the Beancount.io API: `backend-v2` (GraphQL/REST gateway), `ledger-python` (Python Beancount/Fava ledger service with native plugin execution), `idl` (OpenAPI specs + generated clients), and `agent-box` (Cloudflare Worker control plane for the Ask-AI sandbox). Run locally via [`deploy/docker-mac/`](./deploy/docker-mac) or self-host on one server via [`deploy/docker/`](./deploy/docker). |

The dashboard and mobile app are clients for the Beancount.io API, served by `backend-cluster/` — hosted, or self-run via `deploy/docker-mac/`. The CLI and ledger skills also support local-first workflows that do not require the hosted service.

Skills have two audiences:

| Audience | Location | Workflows |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Beancount users | [`skills/`](./skills/README.md), with implementations in [`skills/.claude/skills/`](./skills/.claude/skills) | The eight `beancount-*` ledger skills |
| Repository contributors | [`.agents/skills/`](./.agents/skills), documented in [`.agents/AGENTS.md`](./.agents/AGENTS.md) | PM, shipping, mobile releases, QA, code maintenance, and Mermaid diagrams |

The root `.claude/skills` links to `.agents/skills` so Claude Code and Codex share the internal development workflows.

## Choose your entry point

There is no root package to install. Each package owns its dependencies and checks.

### Web dashboard

Requires Node.js 22, Yarn 4 through Corepack, and a Beancount.io API endpoint.

```zsh
cd dashboard
corepack enable
yarn install --immutable
cp .env.example .env
yarn dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173`. See the [dashboard setup guide](./dashboard/README.md) for environment variables and architecture.

Prefer everything in containers? [`deploy/docker-mac/`](./deploy/docker-mac) runs the full stack locally on macOS. For a persistent single-server installation with automatic HTTPS and durable Docker volumes, use [`deploy/docker/`](./deploy/docker).

### Mobile app

Requires Node.js 20.19.4 or newer and Yarn Classic.

```zsh
cd mobile
yarn install
yarn start
```

Expo will guide you to iOS, Android, or a connected device. See the [mobile development guide](./mobile/README.md) for the full workflow.

### CLI and Python tooling

The `beancount-io` package installs one command, `bea`. You do not install
Beancount yourself — Homebrew provisions a separate engine venv at install
time; PyPI installs provision it on first local use. Install from the
Homebrew tap or from PyPI:

```zsh
brew install bex-co/tap/bea      # macOS and Linuxbrew
uv tool install beancount-io     # anywhere with uv and Python 3.12+

bea check                        # in a directory containing main.bean
bea format -i main.bean          # rewrite; default prints to stdout
bea upgrade                      # update through whichever manager installed it
```

Or from this checkout:

```zsh
cd cli
uv sync --all-groups
uv run bea --help
```

Start with the [first-month tutorial](./cli/docs/TUTORIAL.md), then use the [CLI reference](./cli/docs/USAGE.md) for the command tree, the `--file`/`--json`/`--no-input` automation contract, exit codes, validation, formatting, queries, reports, authentication, and ledger management. Every flag is listed in the generated [command reference](./cli/docs/REFERENCE.md).

### Coding agent skills (local ledger)

Give Claude Code or Codex the eight `beancount-*` ledger workflows. [Install the skills](./skills/docs/installation.md) with a sparse Git clone and one `install` command, then ask a sample ledger a first question with the [first-query walkthrough](./skills/docs/first-query.md).

### Coding agent (MCP)

Point an MCP client at a deployment to query and edit a ledger from an agent:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beancount": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-deployment/api-gateway/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer bcio_your_ledger_scoped_key" }
    }
  }
}
```

Twenty-six tools — BQL queries, file listing, reads, edits, entry and receipt
insertion, appending directives as plain Beancount text, statement parsing,
pull requests, collaborators, API-key management, and bank import — plus
sixty-four URI-addressed **resources** an agent fetches without spending a tool
call: the ledger's vocabulary (payees, currencies, tags, …), its journals and
analysis reads (trial balance, account reports, …), its linked banks, category
suggestions, and file contents. Statements answer with totals and the accounts
behind them rather than a chart payload, every failure names a machine code and
the next call to make, and the transport's budget is sized for a whole agent
session. Four **prompts** — spending report, month-end close, account
reconciliation, and import categorization — hand an agent the ledger playbooks
as workflows the user selects, such as `/mcp__beancount__close-month` in Claude
Code. Every eligible
GraphQL operation now has a REST and MCP twin over the same protected service
call — the parity gap is held at zero by CI. Bank imports are drivable end to
end after a one-time browser link, with `dry_run` on everything that writes.
Every call re-authorizes, so access revoked mid-session is refused on the next
one. A credential can be pinned to one ledger or select `ledger: "owner/name"`
per call. `yarn mcp:conformance <base-url>`
tells you whether a deployment is connectable, and `yarn mcp:agent-eval` runs
real Claude Code and Codex sessions through onboarding tasks and scores their
answers and ledger changes ([MCP agent journeys](./backend-cluster/backend-v2/docs/mcp-agent-eval.md)). See
[connecting an MCP client](./backend-cluster/backend-v2/README.md#connecting-an-mcp-client)
for the walkthrough and
[ADR 0007](./docs/adrs/ADR007-backend-v2-mcp-surface.md) for the
endpoint's contract.

## Quality bar

Every active package has path-filtered CI so unrelated changes stay fast:

| Package   | Run before opening a PR                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard | `cd dashboard && yarn format:check && yarn lint && yarn test && yarn build`       |
| Mobile    | `cd mobile && yarn format:check && yarn lint && yarn typecheck && yarn test:unit` |
| CLI       | `cd cli && make check-all`                                                        |
| Skills    | `python3 skills/scripts/ci-check.py`                                              |

A repository-wide secret scan also gates every push and pull request.
Run `scripts/lint-deadcode.sh` from the repository root to check every executable
package and support script for unused files and symbols. `scripts/fix-deadcode.sh`
applies the available removals; review its diff and rerun the affected packages'
full checks.
